# MyCrypto

This is a simple cryptography project to encrypt and decrypt the given input data based on our selected mode and produces a cipher text for any plain text using Python

𝐂𝐑𝐘𝐏𝐓𝐎𝐆𝐑𝐀𝐏𝐇𝐘 : 
Cryptography is a technique of securing information and communications and transforming it into a new form through the use of codes so that only those person for whom the information is intended can understand it and process it.  
    
𝐄𝐍𝐂𝐑𝐘𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍 :
It is the process of encoding information which converts the original representation of the information into an alternative form called ciphertext. Encrption does not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligeble content to a would-be interceptor

𝐃𝐄𝐂𝐑𝐘𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍 :
Decryption is the process of transforming data that has been rendered unreadable through encryption back to its unencrypted form. In decryption, the system extracts and converts the garbled data and transforms it to texts and images that are easily understandable not only by the reader but also by the system.

𝐂𝐈𝐏𝐇𝐄𝐑𝐓𝐄𝐗𝐓
It is the result of encryption performed on plaintext using an algorithm called a cipher. It is also known as encrypted or encoded information because it contains a form of the original plain text that is unreadable by a human or computer without the proper cipher to decrypt it
